Clickers
========

This is a system for display HTML "slides" and allowing multiple users to submit answers.

The leader (login as `leader`) can select the slides.  Other users can submit answers.

If you're testing this on a non-server implementation of Shiny, run the App from R, and open other, user windows in your browser by going to the appropriate address, e.g. 128.0.0.1:5500
